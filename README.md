## Objectives

1. Create the required controller actions for edit/update/new/create under nested resources

## Overview

Back to the blog entry.

  * Now the goal is to create the `/author/:id/songs/new` and `/author/:id/songs/:id/1` routes
  * First work on the new.
  * Where does the form post to? Make sure that the id stuff moves around
  * Error checking in case someone modifies the action to go to a different author
  * Then copy that stuff over to the songs.
  * Where should things redirect to?
